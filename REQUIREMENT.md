   1. Name  
   2. Email  
   3. photoURL  
   4. Password  
   5. A link that will redirect to the Login page.  
      * For password validation, you need to follow this: must have an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a length of at least 6 characters.  
      * If any of these requirements isn't fulfilled, show an error message/toast.  
      * After successful login or registration, show a toast/SweetAlert.

💡Don’t need to implement forget password just keep a button. Do not need to implement forget password functionality.

### **Home Page (Public)**

* **Banner section:** Design it based on the social development and community-service theme.  
* **Feature section:** Showcase a few features of this application.  
* **Recent Upcoming Events Section:** Show 6 recent upcoming events(using **.limit()** operator of mongodb) based on date which you have added through Create Event Page. Which data you want to show is totally up to you. Show cards on 2 or 3 column grid layouts. **(Dynamic \- Get Data from database)**   
* **Gallery section:** Showcase photographs of different community service events (static).  
* **Newsletter section:** A newsletter subscription section. You have to design this section. No functionality is required for this section.

### **Create Event Page (Private Page)**

There will be a Create Event page to create an event.

**Create Event Functionalities:**

* Any logged-in user is able to create an event.  
* An event will have a title, description, event type (dropdown: Cleanup, Plantation, Donation, etc.), thumbnail Image URL, location, and event date. **Ensure that no past date can be added. The date must be in the future.**  
* You need to keep the user email with the event data of the person creating the event, so you can validate who created it.  
* A **success message** will be shown when the event is created successfully, and the user will be redirected to the Upcoming Events page.

### **Upcoming Events (Public Page)**

Show all events created by users using the Create Event form in a grid layout. Each individual event card will have the event thumbnail, title, location, event type, event date, and a View Event button. You can add more information if you want.

Keep in mind that this page will only show upcoming events. Events whose dates have passed must not appear on this page.

**View Event button functionality**

* By clicking the View Event button, the user will be navigated to the event details page where the user will see the event details. There will also be a **Join Event** button.  
* Users will be able to join an event by clicking the **Join Event** button, and it must be functional.  
* When a user joins an event, store the data in the database along with the event and user data.

**Keep in mind:** The event details page is not a private page. Users can see the details page without logging in. However, to join an event, the user must be logged in.

### **Joined Events Page (Private Page)**

This page will show all events joined by the logged-in user. Show events sorted by event date. 

### **Manage Events Page (Private Page)**

From this page, the user will be able to see all events created by them and update any event data. Also implement delete event functionality to delete an event.

**Keep in mind:** Users can only delete and update their own created event data.

### **Challenge Requirement**

1. **Validation:**  
   * Add validation in the Create Event and Update Event forms.  
   * Add validation in all authentication-related forms.  
2. **Theme Customization:** Add a theme toggling button for changing themes from light to dark / dark to light. Changing the theme should make the full system dark/light based on user interaction.
